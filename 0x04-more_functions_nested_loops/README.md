# Requirements
Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs` <br>
All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc`, using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89` <br>
All your files should end with a new line <br>
A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory <br>
Your code should use the `Betty` style. It will be checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl` <br>
You are not allowed to use global variables <br>
No more than 5 functions per file <br>
You are not allowed to use the standard library. Any use of functions like `printf`, `puts`, etc… is forbidden <br>
You are allowed to use `_putchar` <br>
You don’t have to push `_putchar.c`, we will use our file. If you do it won’t be taken into account <br> <br>
In the following examples, the `main.c` files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, <br>
but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own `main.c` files at compilation.  <br>
Our `main.c` files might be different from the one shown in the examples <br> <br>
The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function `_putchar` should be included in your header file called `main.h` <br>
Don’t forget to push your header file <br>
